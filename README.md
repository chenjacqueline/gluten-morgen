THE GAME:
You (the player) are working as a baker at a German bakery. Throughout your shift you will receive various order requests.

It‚Äôs your responsibility to fulfill these orders by collecting the correct types and quantities of baked goods! Collect the wrong ones however, and you lose your job.

The longer you keep the orders going, the more popular your bakery gets! Which also means the orders get more complex and the speed in which you need to fulfill them increases. Viel Gl√ºck!
